server is listning for connections at 12345
	recived a connection request -> accept it

	recived a request to get mouse and keyboard
		-> create a socket, bind to port
			send the port number to client

The server has a Listner + on_move, on_click, on_press
	The on_move, on_click, on_press will send to the
	currently acitve connection.

**slove the following issue**
server has multible connected clients
	ex: client 1 using socket 1
	       client 2 using socket 2
	       client 3 using socket 3
