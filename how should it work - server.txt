server create a serverSocket, bind it at 12345

server create two workers and pass serverSocket to them. 
	one worker will listen for connections and accept them
			And
	one worker will recive requests

		recive a request (string)
			emit to the server the port number
						+
			send to the client the port number

				the server will create a socket and bind it
				to that port number

				each socket that the server creates will
				be added to a list

				the server has a variable called  activeSharingSocket
				this variable equals the socket that is reciving
				mouse and keyboard 

				to send mouse and keyboard to another client,
				activeSharingSocket will equal another index

the server has a Listner with on_move, on_click, on_press.
these functions will send data on the server variable activeSharingSocket


the client will create a socket and connect it to the port number
	that it recived from the server



client: 
spwan a worker
	create a socket (socket 1)
	create a socket (socket 2)
		(socket 1)
			connect to server at 12345
			send (socket 2) info and res [C!rezX!rezY!socketPort!socketIP]
			(socket 1) close
		(socket 2)
			listning 
			wait for server to send mouse movement


server:
receive [C!rezX!rezY!socketPort!socketIP] (data emited from listningtoconnectionsworker)
	create a socket and connect it to the client socket
	add the socket to socket list

	

send C!rezX!rezY!socketPort!socketIP 
(listning socket)

server: connect to socket
